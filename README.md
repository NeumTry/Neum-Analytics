# Neum Analytics

Showcase for observability analytics captured by Neum AI. The platform captures information across pipelines, files and users. To leverage these capabilities, set up your own pipelines using [dashboard.neum.ai](dashboard.neum.ai). To learn how to create your pipelines see: [Get Started](https://docs.neum.ai/get-started/quickstart)

If you would like a live demo of these capabilities. Please schedule time with us [here](https://calendly.com/neum-ai/neum-ai).

## What is included?

This data provides a comphrehensive picture across:

- Data processing: What was processed? Was it successful? How long did it take?
- File management: What files are available for search? What is their status?
- File auditing: What files are being retrieved through search?
- User auditing: What users are searching for information? What pipelines are they accessing and what files are they accessing within?

The first two areas `Data processing` and `File management` can be found in the [Observability](./Observability.ipynb) file. `File auditing` and `User auditing` can be found in the [Auditing](./Auditing.ipynb) file.
